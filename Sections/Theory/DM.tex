\subsection{Dark matter}
\label{sec:DM}
We have many unanswered mysteries in physics today, but probably the greatest one is the nature of dark matter (DM) \cite{monoZexclusion}. In the previous section's SUSY processes, we have seen that a "consequence" of SUSY may give us some viable DM candidates, namely the LSP neutralino. In this section, we will look at DM particles produced in a more simplified model; that is, a non-supersymmetry model. In this model, we assume that we have a DM mediator (V in figure \ref{fig:monoZFeynman2}) in addition to the DM particles in the final state. This mediator can be, among others, a scalar or a vector. This process's signature consists of detecting a well known SM particle recoiling against missing energy-momentum carried away by DM particles.
