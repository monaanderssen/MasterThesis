\chapter{The Standard Model and beyond}
\label{sec:Theory}
As mentioned in the introduction, we cannot describe all physical phenomena with the Standard Model (SM). There are some problems with the Standard Model, which implies that we need an extension of the SM to understand and explain these problems. There are several different suggested theoretical solutions to these, and one of them is called supersymmetry (SUSY). SUSY introduces multiple new particles as an extension of the SM, but we have not detected any SUSY particles yet. SUSY also gives us some candidates for dark matter (DM), a brief overview of which will be provided in this thesis. Before we discuss SUSY and DM, we begin with a run-through of the SM first.

\section{Beyond the Standard Model}
As mentioned earlier, the SM is not enough to explain every phenomenon in physics and the universe. There are several challenging sides of the SM; for instance, the parameters used in the model are made to fit experimental data and do not come from theoretical principles. 
The SM does not offer a solution to unifying the framework with gravity, the hierarchy problem (a large discrepancy between aspects of the weak force and gravity), or the fact that neutrinos oscillate. The SM does not explain what dark energy and dark matter are either.  

Given these shortcomings, various other theories have been proposed to try and solve some of the open questions. Several expansions of the Standard Model exist, and there are pros and cons to every one of them. Furthermore, even though the search has been going on for years, no concluding scientific evidence has been found to favor one particular SM extension over another. Below we detail an outline of one possibility, SUSY.
