    In this thesis we have been searching for new physics phenomena using ML methods, such as BDTs and NNs. The data used for training and testing the ML methods were collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, and were collected in the period 2015-2018. The ML methods was trained on different compositions of mass splittings and features, and have overall performed very well. Both ML methods have been compared to results done with the more traditional method, cut and count, and ML seems to be more sensitive for the signals we have used.
